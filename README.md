# reputation-manager pallets
Open-source substrate modules for reputation systems. These reputation managers will be pluggable into substrate-based chains and will follow the `IRC-1 (incentive system interface)`, `IRC-2 (incentive distribution mechanism)`, `RRC-1 (reputation engine interface)`, and `RRC-2 (reputation data structure)` standards
