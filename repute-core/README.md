# Repute-core

This module serves as a POC for the modular design for a reputation management system. In the long run, RMS is meant to be pluggable (but engine-wise and incentive-wise) and follow certain standards. But this POC represents a compacted design for RMS.

Incentive system: ranks, repute-power

Engine: Social Networks

Check here to learn more about what these too mean.

With Repute-core, an address can start getting scores by priming. This gives it an initial score of zero. The engine calculates scores based on backings and oppositions from other primed addresses. only post-primed address can back or oppose other accounts. the weight of backings and oppositions depend on multiple criteria, including the voter's current score, % of successfule oppossitions/backings, rank, etc

## Data structures

### General information

```rust
pub struct UserInfo<AccountId, ReputeRank, PrimeStatus> {
    Pub identity: AccountIdentity,
    Pub user_id: UserId,
    Pub Account_status: PrimeStatus,
    Pub total_backers: TotalBackers,
    Pub total_scores_gained: TotalScoresGained,
    Pub total_opponents: TotalOponents,
    Pub total_scores_lost: TotalScoresLost,
    Pub reput_power: ReputePower,
    Pub repute_rank: ReputeRank,
}
```

### Reputation rank of Account

```rust
pub enum rank {
    Primed,
    NoviceRep,
    ReputationBuilder,
    TrustworthyMember,
    ReputationEvaluator,
    EsteemedContributor,
    ReputationGuardian,
    ReputationGuru,
    ReputationMaster,
    DistinguishedReputician,
    ReputationLegend,
    ReputationIcon,
    SupremeReputation,
}
```

### Status of Account

```rust
pub enum PrimeStatus {
    Primed, // for accounts that have been primed but have a score of `zero`
    PostPrimed, // for accounts with scores > `zero`
}
```

## Storage Items
- `TotalPrimed` : Total number of account that have at least the `primed` rank (the `primed` rank is the lowest of all ranks)
- `rankOf` : Rank of an account
- `TotalScoreLostOf` : Total score an account has lost since priming
- `TotalScoreGainedOf` : Total score an account has gained since priming
- `CurrentScoreOf` : Current score of an account
- `TotalOpponentsOf` : Total Opponents of an account
- `TotalBackersOF` : Total backers of an account
- `ReputePowerOf` :  power of voter in governance and effect of voters power on changes to other peopleâ€™s reputation. This is calculated from rank, current score, total opponents, total backers, number of oppositions, number of backings,  percentage of successful oppositions, percentage of successful backings etc
- `StatusOf` : This can be `Primed` or `PostPrimed`

## Calls
- `Prime` : This gives an account a score of `zero`
- `Back` : Used by an account of the `post-primed` status to increase the score of another account
- `Oppose` : Used by an account of the `post-primed` status to decrease the score of another account
- `Rescore` : Used to request that an account be rescored. This will require the lock-up of some reputation parameters, which are destroyed if the attempt to rescore fails


####  To reduce the chances of puppet accounts, The following actions are kept in place: 

- Only accounts above the `Primed` rank can Back, Oppose or Rescore.
- Attempting to rescore will require the lock up of a significant amount of scores, which means only accounts with high reputation can attempt to rescore. If this attempt fails, the locked-up score is slashed
- It'll take a significant amount of efforts to move from the `Primed` rank to higher ranks, even if an accounts has enough scores to attain these ranks. This is in order to avoid spam. `Primed` accounts will need to fulfil other criteria like age of account.
